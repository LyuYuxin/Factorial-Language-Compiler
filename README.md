# About-Compiler

Developed a  toy compiler frontend for a factorial language, which includes a lexical analyzer and a syntax analyzer, among other components.  The purose of this project is to enhance understanding of compiler design and the intricacies of language parsing.

This compiler frontend is designed to process the factorial programming language, facilitating the translation of source code written in that language into an intermediate representation for further processing. 

## lexical analyzer
The lexical analyzer is responsible for tokenizing the input code.

## syntax analyzer
the syntax analyzer checks the grammatical structure, ensuring that it adheres to the defined rules of the language.
